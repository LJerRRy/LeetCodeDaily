# LeetCodeDaily
LeetCode problem solution code. There are two form for you to find the solution by Type or Label.<br>
**Notes:** 
1. "&hearts;" means it seems a little hard for me, just for me, maybe not for you.
2. "&spades;" means it seems easy to be solved, but it exists some better approachs to decrease the Time Complexity or Space Complexity.
3. "&clubs;" means...
4. "&diams;" means...
