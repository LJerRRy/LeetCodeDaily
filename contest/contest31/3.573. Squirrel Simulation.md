## 573. Squirrel Simulation
There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.
## Summary
关键在于松鼠第一次往哪个果仁（nut）走，我刚刚开始一直用tree到nut加上nut到松鼠的距离求最小值，但是如果距离相同的那几个果仁应该如何选择这是个问题。**应该逆向思维，应该用松鼠到nut距离减去nut到tree的距离求最小值**， 这样就完美解决了判断距离相同的果仁应该如何解决。
## Solution

### Approach#1

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(int height, int width, int[] tree, int[] squirrel, int[][] nuts) {
        int ret = 0;
        for(int[] n:nuts){
            ret += 2*dist(n,tree);
        }
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int[] n:nuts){
            int t = (dist(squirrel,n)-dist(tree,n));
            min = Math.min(t,min);
        }
        return ret+min;
    }
    
    private int dist(int[] a, int[] b){
        return Math.abs(a[0]-b[0])+Math.abs(a[1]-b[1]);
    }
}
```
